BIOLOGY 101: Cell Structure and Function
=========================================

Chapter 1: Introduction to Cells

All living organisms are composed of cells. Cells are the basic structural and functional units of life. There are two main types of cells: prokaryotic and eukaryotic.

Prokaryotic Cells:
- Lack a membrane-bound nucleus
- Have circular DNA in a region called the nucleoid
- Examples: bacteria and archaea
- Generally smaller (1-10 micrometers)
- Have ribosomes but no membrane-bound organelles

Eukaryotic Cells:
- Have a true nucleus enclosed by a nuclear membrane
- Contain linear DNA organized into chromosomes
- Found in plants, animals, fungi, and protists
- Generally larger (10-100 micrometers)
- Contain various membrane-bound organelles

Chapter 2: The Cell Membrane

The cell membrane (plasma membrane) is a phospholipid bilayer that surrounds all cells. It acts as a selective barrier, controlling what enters and exits the cell.

Structure:
- Phospholipid Bilayer: Two layers of phospholipids with hydrophilic (water-loving) heads facing outward and hydrophobic (water-fearing) tails facing inward
- Cholesterol: Provides stability and fluidity to the membrane
- Proteins: Integral proteins span the membrane; peripheral proteins attach to the surface
- Carbohydrates: Attached to proteins (glycoproteins) or lipids (glycolipids) for cell recognition

The Fluid Mosaic Model describes the membrane as a fluid structure with proteins embedded like tiles in a mosaic pattern.

Selective Permeability:
The membrane allows some substances to pass freely while restricting others.
- Small, nonpolar molecules (O2, CO2) pass freely
- Water moves through aquaporins
- Ions and large molecules require transport proteins

Chapter 3: Cell Organelles

Nucleus:
- Contains genetic material (DNA)
- Surrounded by nuclear envelope with nuclear pores
- Contains nucleolus (site of ribosome production)
- Controls cell activities and gene expression

Mitochondria:
- Known as the "powerhouse of the cell"
- Site of cellular respiration and ATP production
- Has its own DNA (maternal inheritance)
- Double membrane structure with inner folds (cristae)
- ATP synthesis equation: C6H12O6 + 6O2 -> 6CO2 + 6H2O + ~38 ATP

Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER):
- Rough ER: Has ribosomes attached; synthesizes proteins for export
- Smooth ER: No ribosomes; synthesizes lipids and detoxifies substances

Golgi Apparatus:
- Modifies, packages, and ships proteins and lipids
- Forms vesicles for transport
- Consists of flattened membrane sacs (cisternae)

Ribosomes:
- Site of protein synthesis
- Made of rRNA and proteins
- Found free in cytoplasm or attached to rough ER

Lysosomes:
- Contain digestive enzymes
- Break down worn-out organelles and foreign materials
- pH of about 5 (acidic)

Chloroplasts (in plant cells):
- Site of photosynthesis
- Contains chlorophyll (green pigment)
- Has its own DNA
- Double membrane with internal thylakoid membranes

Chapter 4: Cell Transport

Passive Transport (no energy required):
1. Diffusion: Movement from high to low concentration
2. Osmosis: Diffusion of water across a membrane
3. Facilitated Diffusion: Uses transport proteins

Active Transport (requires ATP):
1. Sodium-Potassium Pump: Moves 3 Na+ out, 2 K+ in
2. Endocytosis: Cell engulfs materials (phagocytosis, pinocytosis)
3. Exocytosis: Cell releases materials via vesicles

Osmotic Conditions:
- Isotonic: Equal solute concentration; no net water movement
- Hypertonic: Higher solute outside; cell shrinks (crenation)
- Hypotonic: Lower solute outside; cell swells (lysis)

Key Terms:
- ATP: Adenosine triphosphate, the energy currency of cells
- DNA: Deoxyribonucleic acid, carries genetic information
- Enzyme: Protein that speeds up chemical reactions
- Organelle: Specialized structures within a cell
- Cytoplasm: Gel-like substance filling the cell
- Homeostasis: Maintaining stable internal conditions
